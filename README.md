A simplified version of a TOR-like Onion Routing system implemented as a project for CSCI 551 Computer Communications at USC. Code not to be viewed by current CSCI 551 students.

There is extensive VM configuration required to run this project, but the code is good for reference. Unfortunatly I did not save all my work and notes from this project, but most of it has been uploaded here. The log.txt file shows a sample output of what would have been very similarly output by my verision of the project.
