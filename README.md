A simplified version of a TOR-like Onion Routing system implemented as a project for CSCI 551 Computer Communications at USC. Code not to be viewed by current CSCI 551 students.

There is extensive VM configuration required to run this project, but the code is good for reference. Unfortunatly I did not save all my work and notes from this project, but most of it has been uploaded here. The log.txt file shows a sample output of what would have been very similarly output by my verision of the project.

This was a very large, multi part project. For the final version (projc), the class was provided a working solution that covered up to projb. I used this code in for projc even though my proja and projb solutions were functional.

The project instructions are included.
